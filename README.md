# Recommendation engines

## Overview
This is a project submission to complete the Udacity Data Science program. In this project I created a recommendation system for the IBM Watson community. The recommendation system suggested articles for users to interact with in multiple ways. 

### Features
The recommender system can make recommendations in a number of ways:
1. Collaborative Filtering
<br>
_Takes into account the similarity of users and recommends the most popular articles read by similar users_
<br>
2. Rank Based Recommendations
<br>
_Recommends the highest ranked articles starting with the most highly ranked_ 
<br>
3. SVD - Matrix Factorization Recommendations
<br>
_Utilises matrix operations to predict the ranking (or in this case the boolean interaction variable)_
